=head1 NAME

Sub::SymMethod - symbiotic methods; methods that act a little like BUILD and DEMOLISH

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use feature 'say';
  
  {
    package Local::Base;
    use Class::Tiny;
    use Sub::SymMethod;
    
    symmethod foo => sub { say __PACKAGE__ };
  }
  
  {
    package Local::Role;
    use Role::Tiny;
    use Sub::SymMethod;
    
    symmethod foo => sub { say __PACKAGE__ };
  }
  
  {
    package Local::Derived;
    use parent -norequire, 'Local::Base';
    use Role::Tiny::With; with 'Local::Role';
    use Sub::SymMethod;
    
    symmethod foo => sub { say __PACKAGE__ };
  }
  
  'Local::Derived'->foo();
  # Local::Base
  # Local::Role
  # Local::Derived

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sub::SymMethod creates hierarchies of methods so that when you call one,
all the methods in the inheritance chain (including ones defined in roles)
are invoked.

They are invoked from the most basal class to the most derived class.
Methods defined in roles are invoked before methods defined in the class
they were composed into.

This is similar to how the C<BUILD> and C<DEMOLISH> methods are invoked
in L<Moo>, L<Moose>, and L<Mouse>. (You should I<not> use this module to
define C<BUILD> and C<DEMOLISH> methods though, as Moo/Moose/Mouse already
includes all the plumbing to ensure that they are called correctly. This
module is instead intended to allow you to define your own methods which
behave similarly.)

You can think of "symmethod" as being short for "symbiotic method",
"syncretic method", or "synarchy of methods".

If you are familiar with L<multi methods|Sub::MultiMethod>, you can think
of a symmethod as a multi method where instead of picking one "winning"
candidate to dispatch to, the dispatcher dispatches to as many candidates
as it can find!

=head2 Use Cases

Symmethods are useful for "hooks". For example, the following pseudocode:

  class Message {
    method send () {
      $self->on_send();
      $self->do_smtp_stuff();
    }
    
    symmethod on_send () {
      # do nothing
    }
  }
  
  role LoggedMessage {
    symmethod on_send () {
      print STDERR "Sending message\n";
    }
  }
  
  class ImportantMessage {
    extends Message;
    with LoggedMessage;
    
    symmethod on_send () {
      $self->add_to_archive( "Important" );
    }
  }

When the C<send> method gets called on an ImportantMessage object, the
inherited C<send> method from Message will get invoked. This will call
C<on_send>, which will call every C<on_send> definition in the inheritance
hierarchy for ImportantMessage, ensuring the sending of the important
message gets logged to STDERR and the message gets archived.

=head2 Functions

Sub::SymMethod exports one function, but which may be called in two
different ways.

=over

=item C<< symmethod $name => $coderef >>

Creates a symmethod.

=item C<< symmethod $name => %spec >>

Creates a symmethod.

The specification hash must contain a C<code> key, and may contain
C<signature>, C<named>, and C<method> keys, which work the same as in
L<Sub::MultiMethod>. It may also include an C<order> key.

=back

=head2 Invoking Symmethods

Given the following pseudocode:

  class Base {
    symmethod foo () {
      say wantarray ? "List context" : "Scalar context";
      return "BASE";
    }
  }
  
  class Derived {
    extends Base;
    
    symmethod foo () {
      say wantarray ? "List context" : "Scalar context";
      return "DERIVED";
    }
  }
  
  my @r = Derived->foo();
  my $r = Derived->foo();

"Scalar context" will be said four times. Symmethods are always invoked in
scalar context even when they have been called in list context!

The C<< @r >> array will be C<< ( "BASE", "DERIVED" ) >>. When a symmethod
is called in list context, a list of the returned values will be returned.

The variable C<< $r >> will be C<< 2 >>. It is the count of the returned
values.

If a symmethod throws an exception this will not be caught, so any further
symmethods waiting to be invoked will not get invoked.

=head3 Invocation Order

It is possible to force a symmethod to run early by setting C<order> to
a negative number.

  symmethod foo => (
    order => -100,
    code  => sub { my $self = shift; ... },
  );

It is possible to force a symmethod to run late by setting order to a
positive number.

  symmethod foo => (
    order => 100,
    code  => sub { my $self = shift; ... },
  );

The default C<order> is 0 for all symmethods, and in most cases this will
be fine.

Where symmethods have the same order (the usual case!) symmethods are invoked
from most basal class to most derived class -- i.e. from parent to child.
Where a class consumes symmethods from roles, a symmethods defined in a role
will be invoked before a symmethod defined in the class, but after any
inherited from base/parent classes.

=head2 Symmethods and Signatures

When defining symmethods, you can define a signature:

  use Types::Standard 'Num';
  use Sub::SymMethod;
  
  symmethod foo => (
    signature => [ Num ],
    code      => sub {
      my ( $self, $num ) = @_;
      print $num, "\n";
    },
  );
  
  symmethod foo => (
    named     => 1,
    signature => [ mynum => Num ],
    code      => sub {
      my ( $self, $arg ) = @_;
      print $arg->mynum, "\n";
    },
  );

When the symmethod is called, any symmethods where the arguments do not match
the signature are simply skipped.

The invocant ($self or $class or whatever) is I<not> included in the
signature.

The coderef given in C<code> receives the list of arguments I<after> they've
been passed through the signature, which may coerce them, etc.

Instead of an arrayref (which will be treated as a signature using
L<Type::Params> C<compile> or C<compile_named_oo>), you can provide a
signature as a coderef. The coderef will be passed a list of argument to
the symmethod to be checked. If the arguments are bad, it should throw an
exception (which will be caught, and the symmethod will be safely skipped).
If the arguments are good, it should return the list of arguments, possibly
after some coercion or other processing.

Using an arrayref signature requires L<Type::Params> to be installed.

=head2 API

Sub::SymMethod has an object oriented API for metaprogramming.

When describing it, we'll borrow the terms I<dispatcher> and I<candidate>
from L<Sub::MultiMethod>. The candidates are the coderefs you gave to
Sub::SymMethod -- so there might be a candidate defined in your parent
class and a candidate defined in your child class. The dispatcher is the
method that Sub::SymMethod creates for you (probably just in the base
class, but theoretically perhaps also in the child class) which is responsible
for finding the candidates and calling them.

The Sub::SymMethod API offers the following methods:

=over

=item C<< install_symmethod( $target, $name, %spec ) >>

Installs a candidate method for a class or role.

C<< $target >> is the class or role the candidate is being defined for.
C<< $name >> is the name of the method. C<< %spec >> must include a
C<code> key and optionally C<named>, C<signature>, C<method>, and
C<order> keys.

If C<< $target >> is a class, this will also install a dispatcher into
the class. Passing C<< no_dispatcher => 1 >> in the spec will avoid this.

If C<< $target >> is a role, this will also install hooks to the role to
notify Sub::SymMethod whenever the role gets consumed by a class. Passing
C<< no_hooks => 1 >> in the spec will avoid this.

This will also perform any needed cache invalidation.

=item C<< build_dispatcher( $target, $name ) >>

Builds a coderef that could potentially be installed into
C<< *{"$target\::$name"} >> to be used as a dispatcher.

=item C<< installer_dispatcher( $target, $name ) >>

Builds a coderef that could potentially be installed into
C<< *{"$target\::$name"} >> to be used as a dispatcher, and
actually installs it.

This complains if it notices it's overwriting an existing
method which isn't a dispatcher. (It also remembers the coderef
being installed is a dispatcher, which can later be checked
using C<is_dispatcher>.)

=item C<< is_dispatcher( $coderef ) >>

Checks to see if C<< $coderef >> is a dispatcher.

Can also be called as C<< is_dispatcher( $coderef, 0 ) >> or
C<< is_dispatcher( $coderef, 1 ) >> to teach it about a coderef.

=item C<< dispatch( $invocant, $name, @args ) >>

Equivalent to calling C<< $invocant->$name(@args) >> except doesn't use
the dispatcher installed into the invocant's class, instead building a
new dispatcher and using that.

=item C<< install_hooks( $rolename ) >>

Given a role, sets up the required hooks which ensure that when the role
is composed with a class, dispatchers will be installed into the class to
handle all of the role's symmethods, and Sub::SymMethod will know that the
class consumed the role.

Also performs cache invalidation.

=item C<< get_roles_for_class ( $classname ) >>

Returns an arrayref containing a list of roles the class is known to
consume. We only care about roles that define symmethods.

If you need to manually specify that a class consumes a role, you can
push the role name onto the arrayref. This would usually only be necessary
if you were using an unsupported role implementation. (Supported role
implementations include L<Role::Tiny>, L<Role::Basic>, L<Moo::Role>,
L<Moose::Role>, and L<Mouse::Role>.)

=item C<< clear_cache( $name ) >>

Clears all caches associated with any symmethods with a given name.
The target class is irrelevent because symmethods can be created in
roles which may be consumed by multiple unrelated classes.

=item C<< get_symmethod_names( $target ) >>

For a given class or role, returns a list of the names of symmethods defined
directly in that class or role, not considering inheritance and composition.

=item C<< get_symmethods( $target, $name ) >>

For a given class or role and a method name, returns an arrayref of spec
hashrefs for that symmethod, not considering inheritance and composition.

This arrayref can be pushed onto to define more candidates, though this
bypasses setting up hooks, installing dispatches, and performing cache
invalidation, so C<install_symmethod> is generally preferred unless you're
doing something unusual.

=item C<< get_all_symmethods( $target, $name ) >>

Like C<get_symmethods>, but I<does> consider inheritance and composition.
Returns the arrayref of the spec hashrefs in the order they will be called
when dispatching.

=item C<< compile_signature( \%spec ) >>

When non-coderef signatures are found, this is called to compile them into
a coderef. It is a small wrapper around L<Type::Params>. Modifies
C<< %spec >> rather than returning a useful value.

=item C<< _generate_symmethod( $name, \%opts, \%globalopts ) >>

This method is used by C<import> to generate a coderef that will be installed
into the called as C<symmethod>.
